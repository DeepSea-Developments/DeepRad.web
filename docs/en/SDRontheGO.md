# SDR on the GO

To connect a DeepRad to an Android device, you need to follow several steps including setting up the hardware and installing the necessary software. Here is a complete guide to do so:

### Requirements:

1. **Hardware:**
    - A DeepRad receiver.
    - A Type-C cable to connect the DeepRad to the USB port of your Android device.
    - An antenna suitable for the type of signals you want to receive.
2. **Software:**
    - An Android-compatible SDR app (such as SDR Touch).
    - The necessary SDR drivers.

### Steps to follow:

### 1. Hardware Setup:

1. **Connecting the DeepRad to the Android device:**
    - Connect the DeepRad receiver to the Type-C cable.
    - Connect the other end of the cable to the USB port of your Android device.
2. **Connect the antenna to the DeepRad:**
    - Make sure the antenna is properly connected to the DeepRad.

### 2. Software Installation:

1. **Install the SDR Touch App:**
    - Go to the Google Play Store on your Android device.
    - Search for "SDR Touch" and download the app.

2. **Install the SDR Drivers:**
    - Once you have installed SDR Touch, you also need to install the drivers.
    - SDR Touch will usually automatically redirect you to install the drivers. If not, you can search for "RTL2832U driver" in the Google Play Store and install the "RTL-SDR Driver" app.

### 3. Setup and Using the App:

1. **Launch SDR Touch:**
    - Launch the SDR Touch app on your Android device.
2. **Connecting the DeepRad:**
    - The first time you launch SDR Touch with the DeepRad connected, the app should ask you for permission to use the USB device. Accept the necessary permissions.
3. **Initial Setup:**
    - Once the app recognizes the DeepRad, you will see several configuration options.
    - You can adjust the frequency, modulation mode (AM, FM, etc.), bandwidth, and other parameters depending on what you want to listen to.
4. **Scanning Frequencies:**
    - Use the app interface to scan different frequencies. You can use the frequency bar to move through the spectrum and search for signals.

### Additional Tips:

- **Antenna:** Antenna quality and type can significantly affect signal reception. Make sure you use an antenna suitable for the frequencies you are interested in.
- **Environment:** Reception may improve if you are in an area with less electromagnetic interference.
- **Power:** Some devices may need additional power to work properly with an SDR, especially if the battery is low.

### Common issues and solutions:

- **DeepRad not detected:** Make sure the Type-C cable is working properly and the DeepRad is properly connected.
- **Issues with reception:** Check that the antenna is properly connected and try different locations to improve reception.
- **App closes or is unresponsive:** Restart your device and try again. Make sure you have the latest software versions.

By following these steps, you should be able to connect and use your DeepRad with an Android device to explore the RF spectrum.
